This project uses OWL API and the PITT architecture (https://github.com/EmaroLab)
to get the shape and parameters of objects in a table top scenarious and manage the 
recognition and the learning of composition of primitive objects only by using
ontological instance cheking.

This software is stable but it has not been generalised and docomunted.
