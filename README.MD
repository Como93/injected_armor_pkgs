#AMOR

**AMOR** - a Multi-Ontology Reference library, is a complete library of helper functions for OWL ontologies with some remarkable features. 

+ Support for multiple ontologies.
+ Ensures thread-safe ontology manipulations.
+ Implements a wide range of functions: from simple "add an individual" to more esoteric "modify an SWRL rule".
+ Excellent performances which can be further customized based on user needs.
+ Ontology debug GUI available (currently working but not stable).
+ Extensive logging.
+ Out-of-the-box support for most reasoners. Easy to add more.
+ Based on latest standards: Java 7 and OWL API 3.4.5 (Support for Java 8 and OWL API 5.X coming soon, check OWL-api5 branch).

This is the ROS version of the library, ready to be included in your ROS projects. We advice to use the [OWL-api4-stable](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/OWL-api4-stable) branch at the moment.

Full documentation coming soon. If you need, you can refer to the code itself since most public functions already come with docstrings.
